# s3_reader

The `s3_reader` can fetch data from an S3 bucket. It works by slicing up the file into byte chunks that encompass complete records determined by the format parameter so that they can be independently read from the file.

For this processor to run, a path is required in the configuration. All intermediate directories must pre-exist, and the workers will need to have adequate permissions to read from that directory.

This reader currently only works in `once` jobs.

If you are using the asset version >= 2.4.0, it should be used on teraslice >= v84.0

## Usage

### Read ldjson from a file
This test job will find and read the files in the `/app/data/test_files`. In this example, the TS cluster could be a single-node cluster or a multi-node cluster where `/app/data` is directory shared between all the workers.

 Example Job

```json
{
  "name": "s3_reader",
  "lifecycle": "once",
  "workers": 10,
  "max_retries": 0,
   "assets": [
    "file"
  ],
  "operations": [
    {
        "_op": "s3_reader",
        "path": "/app/data/test_files",
        "size": 100000,
        "format": "ldjson"
    },
    {
        "_op": "noop"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is a representation of what the processor will do with the configuration listed in the job above

```javascript
const slice =  {
    path: '/app/data/test_files/someFile.txt',
    offset: 0,
    total: 364,
    length: 364
}

const results = await reader.run(slice);

results === [{ some: 'records'}, { more: 'data' }]
```

## Advanced Configuration

### `format`

#### json

`json` format treats every file as a single JSON record, so all files **MUST ONLY CONSIST OF A SINGLE RECORD OR ARRAY OF JSON RECORDS**. The reader will automatically detect whether the file is a record or array of records, and if it is an array of records, the reader will return a data entity for each record. This setting will tell the execution controller to ignore the `size` parameter and will provide one full file for every slice.

#### ldjson

`ldjson` format will treat files as a set of line-delimited JSON records. line  delimiters other than `\n` can be used, but the `line_delimiter` option must be set in this case.

#### tsv

`tsv` format will treat files as a set of tab-delimited values. If using the `tsv` input format, the **FIELDS OPTION MUST BE PROVIDED AS WELL**. As with `ldjson`, a custom line delimiter can be used with the `line_delimiter` parameter. Providing `tsv` as the format is the same as providing the `csv` option with `\t` as the `field_delimiter`.

#### csv

`csv` format will treat files as a set of values delimited by the `field_delimiter` option. `field_delimiter` defaults to `,`, but if multi-character or custom delimiters are needed, `csv` should be selected here and used in conjunction with the `field_delimiter` option. **FIELDS OPTION MUST BE PROVIDED AS WELL.** Custom line delimiters can be used with `line_delimiter`

#### raw

`raw` format will treat files as a set of raw string separated by the `line_delimiter`, and each string will be stored in the `data` attribute of a data entity. The reader will make sure slices split on the `line_delimiter` so partial lines do not show up in records.

### API usage in a job
In file_assets v1, many core components were made into teraslice apis. When you use a file processor it will automatically setup the api for you, but if you manually specify the api, then there are restrictions on what configurations you can put on the operation so that clashing of configurations are minimized. The api configs take precedence.

If submitting the job in long form, here is a list of parameters that will throw an error if also specified on the opConfig, since these values should be placed on the api:
- `path`


`SHORT FORM (no api specified)`
```json
{
  "name": "s3_reader",
  "lifecycle": "once",
  "workers": 1,
  "max_retries": 0,
  "assets": [
    "file",
    "standard"
  ],
  "operations": [
    {
      "_op": "s3_reader",
      "path": "/app/data/test_files",
      "format": "tsv",
      "file_per_slice": true,
      "include_header": true,
      "size": 100000
    },
    {
        "_op": "noop"
    }
  ]
}
```

this configuration will be expanded out to the long form underneath the hood
`LONG FORM (api is specified)`

```json
{
  "name": "s3_reader",
  "lifecycle": "once",
  "workers": 1,
  "max_retries": 0,
  "assets": [
    "file",
    "standard"
  ],
  "apis": [
      {
          "_name": "s3_reader_api",
          "path": "/app/data/test_files",
          "format": "tsv",
          "file_per_slice": true,
          "include_header": true,
          "size": 100000
      }
  ],
  "operations": [
    {
      "_op": "s3_reader",
      "api_name": "s3_reader_api"
    },
    {
        "_op": "noop"
    }
  ]
}
```
